TEK-9 Clothing is a full-stack web application, meticulously designed to simulate a modern-day online clothing store. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), this project showcases a dynamic and robust user interface, comprehensive authentication system, and an efficient database design. Developed independently over a period of one month, TEK-9 Clothing offers a glimpse into the future of e-commerce platforms.
